Forget about France being crowned champions after two decades of futile failure; let’s focus more on the Croatia lady president. I mean if there are words that can describe her then incredible and phenomenal have to be in the mix. It is not every day we see a woman with her arms up cheering on her squad.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/1120/0fgjhs3np61mud8hfg.jpeg><p class=align-left>So, what is it about the president of Croatia that has made her the talk of town? Well if you haven’t seen her pictures online then you are missing out on a lot. She was such an enigma and a fountain of inspiration to his team even though they were edged out 4-2 by France. It was how she carried herself even after and before the tournament that swept us all her feet. We review some of the highlights that made it for us despite France taking home the World Cup.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/49e954fa5031380c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Grammy Awards 2020: The best and worst dressed celebrities</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Was it her smile, charisma, leadership style or her totally insane online pictures that made her the highlight of the tournament? It was definitely a concoction of the sugar, spice and everything nice that made us swayed by her. Here are occasions which made us drool and give a round of applause for the awesome leader that she is.</p><h2><strong>1. Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic bikini picture shots</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/49e954fa5031380c.jpeg><p class=align-left>Croatia president pictures of her in a bikini running down the beach surfaced on internet and obviously made rounds for all the good and right reasons. Well, if you haven’t seen them, then you most probably must be living under a rock. Some people were arguing that, that is not the way a president should carry herself, but fact remains fact, if you have it flaunt it. She really has set her pace for other women leaders who are held back by the protagonist men.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b620a9997de87b29.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Miss Universe 2019 winner: 15 stunning photos of South African, Zozibini Tunzi</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Despite Kolinda Grabar-Kitavoric age being advanced she surely has a youthful vibe to it. All eyes were on her at each of the tournament as people were mesmerized by her beauty and brains all wrapped in one. Even though Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic husband, Jakov Kitarovic, was not to be seen anywhere in the tournament, this did not stop her from mingling with the resto of the supporters.</p><h2><strong>2. She portrayed humility at its best</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhsfo0j2obbev8.jpeg><p class=align-left>Most of the leaders around the world are known for the lavish lifestyles they lead. It is still fresh in our minds how our Kenyan leaders took a word class ticket to the same tournament at the expense of you the Kenyan taxpayer. As for the Croatian president, this did not settle well with her as she took an economy class flight with her fellow compatriots to the tournament. She even had time to take selfies with the fans, I mean how awesome can one possibly be.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/20a249420eb925d0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is the sexiest woman alive in 2021?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>You know how viewing the match from the VVIP area is an ultimate prestige. That place is a haven for the elite in the world. We even saw Mike Jagger, Will Smith and his son Jaden Smith of the “icon” hit song share the same stage. For Kolinda Grabar all these glitters weren’t enough to hold her back from joining the rest of the fans in the regular people stands. When Mandzukic scored the second goal of the night after a mishap by France goalkeeper Lloris, she was seen celebrating even in the face on imminent defeat.</p><h2><strong>3. President of Croatia constantly in Croatia jersey</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b620a9997de87b29.jpeg><p class=align-left>Wearing a red and white team jersey, Grabar Kitarovic attended every single match that Croatia played. During one of the most contentious matches of the tournament that pitched Russia and Croatia and saw it go to a goal kick out, she was highly motivated as she cheered her team to victory. During the closing ceremony of the tournament that saw France crowned champions, she still remained loyal and chose the red and white team jersey instead of the office suit.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c8171740444f9650.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kush Tracey: 10 hottest photos you should check out</span></p></a><p class=align-left>She was also a team spirit shouting on the inspired Croatia team which really dominated the last match but unfortunately lost due to the force of unstoppable Mbappe who really terrorized the defense it wasn’t for Croatian defender Vida. It was also a shocker when former FIFA president Putin showed up at the coronation. President Grabar was really accommodative as she handed him the Croatian team jersey engraved with his name “Putin” at the back. The casual dress code was however broken by the France president Emmanuel Macron who wore a suit to the event.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> 2018 World Cup predictions</p><h2><strong>4.

The moment Antonio Griezman’s shot saw the back of the net, all was doom for the team which had put up a spirited fight. Despite imminent defeat, never at one point did president Croatia football support falter. She was all in when it came to cheering her squad on. The moment the whistle blew to call the end of the match, it as all cheers for France but a big round of applause for Croatia.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9bb92b8836587547.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Meet Amber Gill through her hot pics</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Did you see how everyone received hugs after the match? Well she showed her unwavering support to all the Croatian players. Let’s face it, France might have won the game but honestly speaking Croatia won our hearts. They had faced a hard time in the qualifiers nearly being edged out by the hosts Russia but she stood by their side with the fans and this saw them go all the way through the finals.</p><h2><strong>5. Dancing in the rain</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/20a249420eb925d0.jpeg><p class=align-left>It was spectacular moment when the heavens opened up and started pouring when the players were being handed the medals of honor. We saw the former FIFA president Putin covered with an umbrella. But not for president Grabar who stood out in the rain. Did I mention that she had on expensive hair? The rain poured on her but she stood with the players as they were awarded the medals.</p><p class=align-left>It was a sight to see when captain Luka Modric who was a former refugee took home the Golden Ball. He really did an amazing job in the midfield area which was why Croatia succeeded in the tournament. Despite losing a penalty that could have seen them get knocked off at the semi final stage, his team pulled through and assured them a victory. It was pretty evident that the president was extra jovial to the success of her compatriot. She celebrated in the rain with the rest of the team without an umbrella.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/fc10daa8397114dc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Vera Sidika flaunts her new boyfriend online</span></p></a><h2><strong>6.

Pictures surfaced of her in the locker room with the rest of the Croatian team in a celebratory mood. The mere fact that she stormed the boy’s locker room to continue the post-winning celebration proved that she is really a good leader. Another moment that stood up was when Croatia and England were held to a goalless draw. England defender Trippier has made the Croatians lose all their hopes after an ingenious free kick in the beginning of the game.</p><p class=align-left>When striker Perisic equalized with a thunderous shot, Grabar was up on her feet cheering and chanting for her team. Even when the game had to go to extra time to determine the winner, she was captured urging the rest of the fans to show motivation to the team mates. When Mandzukic finally capitalized and crushed the dreams of England at ever reaching the World Cup finals, she was full of bliss. Despite losing the cup to France, she still continued to celebrate with the rest of the members at the success of the club.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/170371fbf90c6d40.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Latest celebrity news: Vera Sidika's marriage proposal, Erick and Chantal speak up & more</span></p></a><h2><strong>7.

It was pretty evident that she was geared up to take home the World Cup despite losing it to France. On that fateful day, Croatia made two historical moments, reaching the finals for the first time in history and having the best leader a country could ever ask for. Luka Modric was all shattered after losing on a golden opportunity but she took him into her warm hands and encouraged him.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>World cup 2018 best players</p><p class=align-left>It was a nice display of sportsmanship as he stood in the middle of the rain to shake the hands of even the other players.

On-screen, the two had a solid romantic pairing, and it spilt over off-screen as they grew fond of one another.</p><p class=align-left>They fell in love and fans were delighted. After they started dating, they moved in together in an apartment in Los Angeles.</p><p class=align-left>Their relationship grew strong over time, as they were together for seven years. During this time, the couple formed a fantastic bond, envied by other celebrities in Hollywood and admired by fans. Their on-screen romance was top-notch, and their relationship hardly affected their acting careers.</p><p class=align-left>Maggie Lawson <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">went back to theatre</a> in 2011, a significant decision in her career.

Even though they had separated, they continued their on-screen romance.</p><h3>Why did James Roday and Maggie Lawson break up?</h3><p class=align-left>Famous personalities' break-ups are often scandalous. However, James Roday and Maggie Lawson's break-up was low-key, and fans were left wondering what happened between the two.</p><p class=align-left>Despite all the efforts made to find out why they broke up, nothing has ever come out. Instead, James and Maggie stayed silent and moved on without uttering a word about their separation.</p><p class=align-left>Fans were heartbroken when they found out that they had separated, as many wished them a happy and long-term relationship. Fortunately, the audience got somewhat what they desired in the sequel of the TV series <i>Psych: The Movie</i> and <i>Psych 2: Lassie Come Home</i>, where James Roday married Maggie.</p><h3>What has James Roday been up to since his split with Maggie?</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9b05bf07e7ba18b0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Shane Maguire and Nicole Curtis: relationship, baby, latest updates</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/ec0b422b381d0076.jpeg><p class=align-left>James Roday has never been a high-profile person and has stuck to the same routine after the break-up with actress Maggie Lawson. As a result, it is hard knowing anything about his relationships, and people are not even aware if he is currently dating.</p><p class=align-left>The weirdest thing is that people do not know his past relationships if he had anyone special in his life. And it seems it will be more challenging learning about his future if he doesn't date or marry a famous personality.</p><p class=align-left>However, there have been rumours about his alleged affair with American actress Mandy Moore from 2014 to 2015. However, keep in mind that it is only speculation as the actor has never come out to confirm the story.</p><p class=align-left>By the look of things, James has been busy <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">building his career</a>. He had co-owned a theatre firm called Red God that produced plays including <i>Extinction</i> and <i>Sexual Perversity </i>but has shifted focus on working behind the camera.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d062e084a5eb53ad.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Gina Carano's husband?

And it was Ben Koldyke, a fellow actor that he met on the cast of <i>Back in the Game</i>. They started dating in 2014, a few months after meeting.</p><p class=align-left>Their relationship got serious when Ben proposed to Maggie on November 14, 2014, and she said yes.

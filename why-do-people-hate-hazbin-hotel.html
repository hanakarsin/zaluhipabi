The show is a vision by Vivienne "Vivziepop" Medrano who created, wrote, directed, and produced the show. It was a hit on YouTube, but after good news was released and wasn't received very well, we got to ask: Why do people hate Hazbin Hotel?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is 'Hazbin Hotel'?</h2><p>Hazbin Hotel is a web series that was released on YouTube following a character named Charlie, the princess of Hell. The show follows her quest to open a hotel with the hopes of rehabilitating demons.&nbsp;</p><p>"After a yearly extermination imposed by angels, she opens a hotel in hopes that patients will be 'checking out' into Heaven," the description reads. "While most of Hell mocks her goal, her devoted partner Vaggie, and their first test subject, adult film-star Angel Dust, stick by her side. When a powerful entity known as the 'Radio Demon' reaches out to Charlie to assist in her endeavors, her crazy dream is given a chance to become a reality."&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>The pilot episode aired on YouTube on Oct. 28, 2019 and it was well received with over 40 million views. The show developed a dedicated fanbase, including 3.6 million people who subscribed to her YouTube channel and anxiously awaited more episodes of Hazbin Hotel.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">On Aug. 7, it was announced that 'Hazbin Hotel' was picked up for a TV series.</h2><p>A24, an independent distributor and production company that's known for hits like Moonlight, Lady Bird, and Uncut Gems, announced that they've struck a deal to produce a series based on the Hazbin Hotel web series.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I can't express how excited I am!

Investing in yourself should be a continuous endeavour.</p>The stock market is filled with individuals who know the price of everything, but the value of nothing. - Phillip Fisher<p class=align-left>This lays further emphasis on the fact that investing without research or education will lead to failure and irrational investment decisions. While listening to popular opinion is not bad, inability to study and carry out your own research is detrimental.</p>Landlords grow rich in their sleep. - John Stuart Mill<p class=align-left>If you are looking for a passive form of investment, then real estate is your best bet and this one of the many real estate investment quotes to fuel you on.

They did not wait for it to become news. As such, they were the pioneers and the first beneficiaries of the enormous returns. When the news is already out, chances are it's too late to invest. This is one of the best investment quotes.</p>In investing, what is comfortable is rarely profitable. - Robert Arnott<p class=align-left>In most cases, we play it safe by investing where we feel comfortable, however, remember that the higher the risk, the higher the rate of return. While things may go wrong, there are times you need to move out of your investment comfort zone and try something new. For instance, the people who first <a href=# title="bitcoin earliest adopters" rel="nofollow noopener">invested in Bitcoins</a> when everyone was skeptical made huge returns.</p>The four most dangerous words in investing are: 'this time it's different. - Sir John Templeton <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d5c1a12f1d25436d.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to get angel investors in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Granted, sometimes the market will surprise you. However, this does not mean that you throw all caution to the wind. Looking at market history and trends is important. These are the best predictors of the future. For instance, if you are investing in bonds, check its performance for the last five years.</p>How many millionaires do you know who have become wealthy by investing in savings accounts? I rest my case. - Robert G. Allen<p class=align-left>Investing in a savings account is playing it safe. These accounts often come with meagre interest rates. Savings accounts should ideally be used for emergencies. If you wish to get a higher rate of return, then you need to make bold investments. While the risk is higher, the potential for high returns is also higher.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/e6c8d62d46fdc9e0.jpeg>I will tell you how to become rich.

This is called the herd mentality. In the world of investing, you need to think against the mob. When others are greedy and going for a particular stock, then be fearful, when others are fearful be greedy and invest then. Think against the crowd, and you stand to gain more; otherwise, most people would be rich.</p>Every once in a while, the market does something so stupid it takes your breath away. - Jim Cramer<p class=align-left>This quote further emphasises the fact that in investment and life in general, there are no sure bets.

Real investment requires careful study of the market, proper planning and the right strategies.</p>There is a myth out there that passive investing yields lower returns than active investing. But with the right strategies, this does not have to be the case. With the right strategies, a passive investment can sometimes out-perform an active investment. - Anonymous<p class=align-left>This is one of those passive investment quotes that emphasises on the benefits of having your money works for you without you doing much of the selling and buying activities.

Stocks and companies go down, and this is the best time to buy and then sell once the crisis is over. Sadly, most people hoard their money and fail to take advantage of the crisis.</p>Successful investing is about managing risk, not avoiding it. - Benjamin Franklin<p class=align-left>Investments and risk go hand in hand. The strategy is not to invest with the mindset that you will prevent risk but instead look for ways to hedge against risk. Staying informed and up to date with the changes in the market is one way to ensure that you are not caught off guard.</p>An important key to investing is to remember that stocks are not lottery tickets. - Peter Lynch<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs1htuvm7ie528.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Quotes about change in life</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Stocks take time and deep knowledge of the market. If you wish to be an active trader, then you need to invest the time to study the trends or patterns. If this is a lot to juggle, you can be a passive investor and allocate a firm or individual to handle the trading for you.</p>Never invest in stocks with borrowed money or a faint heart. Both are fatal - Manoj Arora<p class=align-left>Most of the most responsible investment quotes are about separating stocks and gambling. Shares are not a sure bet, as such do not borrow money to buy. You should only trade with what you are prepared to lose. This is not a gamble. Again, you need to keep your emotions in check when buying stocks, being emotional can make you irrational and you may end up losing or taking gambles that will hurt your stock portfolio.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/5a2a7357d58a455d.jpeg>Investment is somewhat like cricket, where you change your game plan as per the format. - Vijay Kedia<p class=align-left>Stocks and most investment markets are volatile; you need to have a game plan based on the trends and events of the day. This game plan may change from time to time, and as such, you need to be flexible. While there may be constants and patterns, you will need to think on your feet and come up with game plans.</p>Wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are doing. - Warren Buffett<p class=align-left>This quote is not against diversifying your portfolio, however, too much diversification could mean that you do not know what you are doing. Again, you only diversify if you have the time to monitor all the stocks. Remember that investment is more about managing risk, as such, take calculated risks.</p>You get recessions, you have stock market declines. If you don't understand that's going to happen, then you're not ready, you won't do well in the markets. - Peter Lynch<p class=align-left>Stock markets hit declines once in a while, but eventually, they rise. It is vital that you understand this right from the onset so that you do not get into investing with unrealistic expectations. The best time to buy stocks is when they decline, and then you can reap when they recover.</p>If you have trouble imagining a 20% loss in the stock market, you shouldnât be in stocks. - John Bogle<p class=align-left>There will be highs and lows in the stocks market as you have seen in most of the quotes on investment. If a 20 percent loss scares you, then you do not have the stamina and shock absorbers needed to remain in the market. In as much as you anticipate winnings, you must also expect losses. Such is life, and the same applies to trading stocks.</p>The best investment quotes on the need to invest in yourself - anonymous<p class=align-left>Investing in stocks is important for building your stock portfolio, but we must not forget the need to invest in yourself. You are your biggest asset, and you need to invest and grow you. Investing in yourself helps you to achieve your goals. The wise never stop learning, and the journey of personal development is continuous. Here are great quotes on investing in yourself.</p>There is no more profitable investment than investing in yourself. It is the best investment you can make; you can never go wrong with it. It is the true way to improve yourself to be the best version of you and lets you be able to best serve those around you. - Roy T. Bennett<p class=align-left>You can only share with others what is intrinsically in you. If you wish to raise better children, then you must invest in knowledge. Take time to educate yourself and learn about the things that matter. For instance, if you wish to handle finances better in your marriage, you can invest in financial literacy classes.</p>An investment in self-development pays the highest dividends. - Debasish Mridha<p class=align-left>You can make or lose money when you invest in stocks, but an investment in you can never be lost.

In a world where there is so much information, you have no excuse not to invest in yourself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d5c1a12f1d25436d.jpeg>Income seldom exceeds personal development. - Jim Rohn<p class=align-left>Often, people chase money and once they get it they find that they lack the discipline to save it and grow it. It is not enough to get money, invest in yourself so that you will not squander or misappropriate it. Your income and investments will only grow to the level of your <a href=# title="personal development" rel="nofollow noopener">personal development and discipline</a>.</p>You cannot dream yourself into a character; you must hammer and forge yourself one. - Henry David Thoreau<p class=align-left>It is easy to sit and daydream about the person you want to be and the things you wish to accomplish. However, if you do not work towards this, then it remains a pipe dream at best. The character must be forged by personal development and investing in oneself.</p>Personal development is a major time-saver. The better you become, the less time it takes you to achieve your goals. - Brian Tracy<p class=align-left>Perhaps you have been stalling to enrol in a class on personal development even when you know it's good for you. Most times, we count the money and time involved to take these courses. However, you save time by investing in yourself because this only means that you realise your goals sooner.</p>Life is growth. If we stop growing, technically and spiritually, we are as good as dead. -Morihei Ueshiba<p class=align-left>Growth is a lifetime pursuit. It should be a lifestyle. Again, so much is changing around us, and we need to stay updated especially in the technological world. Take the time to invest in yourself so that you remain relevant and useful to those around you.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: How to succeed in life</strong></p>The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be. - Ralph Waldo Emerson<p class=align-left>Often, we may want to blame life circumstances or tragedies that have happened to us for being who are. However, some people had less than you had and went ahead to do more than you have. Life circumstances notwithstanding, you are ultimately the person you choose to be.</p>Change equals self-improvement. Push yourself to places you havenât been before. - Pat Summitt<p class=align-left>If you want to make changes in your life, then improve yourself. Personal development sets new horizons and takes off the limits you have placed on yourself. It gives you the much-needed confidence to go after the things that looked impossible before. If you want to go further, invest inwards.</p>There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self. - Ernest Hemingway<p class=align-left>We live in a generation of comparing ourselves to others. The pursuit has been trying to keep up with the competition. However, true nobility and strength are becoming better than the person you were yesterday. Quit comparing yourself with others and work on becoming a better you every day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs3o4s1ujkfe9g.jpeg>Growth is the great separator between those who succeed and those who do not. When I see a person beginning to separate themselves from the pack, itâs almost always due to personal growth. - John C. Maxwell<p class=align-left>People who embark on personal growth stand distinctively against the pack. They do not have the herd mentality. They think differently, and as a result, they achieve more than the people who think averagely. Every great leader invests in themselves continuously.</p>âPersonal development is the belief that you are worth the effort, time and energy needed to develop yourself.â - Denis Waitley<p class=align-left>Wondering why you should invest in yourself? Well, because you are worth it. Spending time and money on you is affirming that you are worth the time and effort. This is one of the best treats you can give yourself. Do it because you deserve the ultimate best and you owe it to yourself.</p><p class=align-left>Investing is the best way to secure your financial independence and increase your chances of staying financially stable no matter what.

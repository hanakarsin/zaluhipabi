gospel&nbsp;</strong></p><p>According to reports, a pastor's wife met with her untimely death at the hands of assailants&nbsp;yesterday, July 9.</p><p>Born on July 23, 1974, 42-year-old Eunice Elisha was a deaconess at the Divine Touch parish of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, (RCCG) Old NEPA Road, Phase 4, Kubwa. She had gone out to evangelize along Gbazango-West area of Kubwa, when she was hacked to death by unknown assailants suspected to be extremists.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkyt354oqcp9stv.jpeg><p>The mother of 7&nbsp;was reportedly cut in the neck and stabbed in the stomach and was left in a pool of her blood. Her bible, megaphone and mobile phone were found on the floor beside her body.</p><p>Speaking to reporters, her husband of 16 years, Olawale Elisha, who is also a pastor at the RCCG, had this to say:</p><p><i>“My wife always went out early in the morning for ‘Morning Cry’ (evangelism). There was a particular day she went out and she told me that there was a mosque at the back where they commented about what she said.&nbsp;So I just cautioned her. This morning (Saturday), she went out. Two of my boys are footballers, thus, they went to the football pitch to play. And when they came back, they told me that they heard some footballers saying that some hoodlums had butchered a woman who was preaching early this morning.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkytbkge9mr4ing.jpeg><p><i>When I heard this, wearing only a pair of shorts, we walked towards the area my son had said the incident occurred; we didn’t see anybody but we saw blood on the ground. I asked a policeman around and he said it was true but that they had taken the body to Phase 4 Police Station.&nbsp;I went to the police station with my children and when we got there, I saw the lifeless body of my wife at the back of a police van. She was later taken to a mortuary. My wife was so committed to anything that is of God. She was a reckless giver to God’s work.</i></p><p><strong>PAY ATTENTION:&nbsp;</strong>Get the latest gossips on Naij Gossip App</p><p><i>She rarely missed any programme in the church. We have seven children. I see her as a martyr and she died for Christ and whether the people are caught or not, they should forgive them. My prayer is that if they can accept Christ, that will be a gain to Christ.”</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt7b588aaip5b.jpeg><p>While talking to the wife of the vice president Mrs Dolapo Osinbajo whose husband is also a pastor in the RCCG,&nbsp;the deceased's husband said his wife had no quarrels with anyone that could have led to her murder, and described her as a martyr.</p><p>Mr Olawale also said&nbsp;a muslim cleric once came to their house asking his wife to give him food, stating that he had an Islamic school and thus needed some food, she had told him there was no food in the house. Her second son John James corroborated the story, saying that his mother had sent him to tell the strange man that there was no food.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt3v3851nm4vtg.jpeg><p>According to James, after the strange man came to their house, the deceased suddenly took ill and almost died from the sickness, he also said his mother had insisted the sickness was caused by the mallam.</p><p>When the wife of the general overseer of the RCCG paid a condolence visit, Olawale told her that his late wife was a committed child of God and <i>"reckless giver to God’s work, she rarely missed any program in the church. We have seven children."</i></p><p>In a press statement released by the&nbsp;FCT Command's commissioner of police Alkali Baba Usman, the deputy commissioner of police in charge of the Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (CIID) has been assigned to lead an investigation into the murder case.</p><p>Baba Usman also said the six suspects arrested in connection with the murder are currently undergoing interrogation in police custody. He also assured that the outcome of the investigation will be made public. While commiserating with the deceased's family, he reassured them of the police's commitment and determination to bring the people involved in the murder, to justice. He also urged&nbsp;the residents of the area and members of the public to remain calm and aid the&nbsp;police with their investigations.</p><p>Baba Usman also debunked the reports in the media that said the deceased's head and leg were severed. Here's what he said:</p><p><i>"The Command wants to state that apart from marks of injury inflicted on some parts of her body, all parts of the deceased body are intact. The Police has taken custody of her remains for preservation and examination."</i></p><p>See more pictures from the Mrs Osinbajo's visit below:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt7ctphdfavac.jpeg><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt3le0la98hnkg.jpeg><p>Residents of the area where the deceased was murdered have reportedly fled, for fear of arrest or more attacks.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkhXmBl21oZquYpLCstc2gZKubk5x6sa3Sraarq12stqexjKasq5yVp7Klec%2Bhpq2nXp3Brrg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./witney-carson-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Witney Carson - Age, Family, Bio</a>

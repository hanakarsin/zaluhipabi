viewers, with many claiming that it was much easier to thrive financially as a "boomer" than any other era.</p><p>The median price of a home in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">United States these days is $395,100</a>, as of this writing according to Fast Company. The US Market Historical Conditions database stated that the median price of a home in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1984 throughout the country was $79,900</a>.</p><p>"How much did you pay for your first house?" the man on the microphone asks a man in a blue shirt pushing a cart through the Home Depot in one of his videos.</p><p>"$37,000 for it," the man replies, leaving the Influencer with his jaw-dropping to the ground.</p><p>"But that was in 1980," he concedes. As of this writing, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SavvyDollar</a>, $37,000 in 1980, adjusted for inflation, is worth $147,973.95, or around four times what our currency is worth today.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@dangeloruff href=#>@dangeloruff</a><p>I‚Äôm so confused ü§® <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=trending href=#>#trending</a> <a title=dangeloruff href=#>#dangeloruff</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Deloü¶Ñ" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Deloü¶Ñ</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @dangeloruff</span></figure><p>He then asks the woman walking behind the gentleman if that was her first house, but the man quickly explains that the woman walking with him is his mother-in-law. So the TikToker wanted to know how much she paid for her first home: "My first house was $16,000," she says, smiling into the camera. Again, this leaves the TikToker speechless as he looks into the camera.</p><p>Delo kept the series going in another video where he approached another couple shopping in another store: "How much did you pay for your first house?" he asked the couple. The woman, who is wearing a red jacket turns and answers the man: "$25,000."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@dangeloruff href=#>@dangeloruff</a><p>I‚Äôm so confused ü§® <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=trending href=#>#trending</a> <a title=dangeloruff href=#>#dangeloruff</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Deloü¶Ñ" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Deloü¶Ñ</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @dangeloruff</span></figure><p>Delo stammers a little bit towards the camera before turning back to the couple, "What year was this?" he asks, before the woman ruminates a bit before answering: "Oh my Gosh, 45 years ago."</p><p>"We on TV?" the man who is with her asks Delo.</p><p>"Yeah what you gotta say to them," Delo tells the couple, before the woman responds, "Hopefully not YouTube."</p><p>"Nuthin' really," the man says before the video cuts out.</p><p>In another video that appears to have been recorded at a Walmart location, Delo poses the same question to another woman who stands in front of her cart u ‚Äî an assortment of tumblers and pitchers are behind her.</p><p>"No," the woman says as she backs away from the camera and begins to walk away from the man who posed the question.</p><p>"We're not gonna do that," the woman says as she pushes her cart away from the man.

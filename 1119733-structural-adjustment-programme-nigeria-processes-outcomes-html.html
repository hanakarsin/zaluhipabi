The country's economy relied heavily on oil production and mineral exports, bringing quick and easy money.</p><p class=align-left>Within a few years, oil prices collapsed to less than $10 per barrel. In 1969, the oil sector accounted for less than 3% of Nigeria's GDP, and more than half of GDP came from the agricultural industry. Therefore, the country shifted its<a href=#> focus to agriculture </a>and manufacturing to support its stagnating economy.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/40857714ebf72f1e.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Egypt's educational visa for international students gives right of residency to Nigerians, others</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Since the government's <a href=#>sources of income </a>did not generate enough money to develop the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, they turned to the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for financial assistance.</p><p class=align-left>Eventually, in 1986, Nigeria's then-president Ibrahim Babangida adopted a Structural Adjustment Programme recommended by the IMF and WB.

Besides, the programme also caused some problems in Nigeria. Below are some of the negative <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">effects of the 1986 SAP</a> on the country:</p><ul><li><strong>The 1986 SAP only benefited some people.</strong> — While people in the living standards of rural areas improved, life for middle-class Nigerians and<strong> </strong><a href=#>civil servants</a> worsened. The government reduced the expenditures on the social infrastructure to keep the fiscal policy in check, unaware that this would reduce people's wages and worsen their living standards.</li><li><strong>SAP was working but at a slow pace.</strong> — Inflation level barely improved. Nigeia's per capita income rose by 2% annually, meaning it would take at least thirty years for the economy to reach its 1980 level. Meanwhile, the Naira depreciated up to 80% against the U.S. dollar.</li><li><strong>Corruption increased in government. </strong>— Corrupt politicians, including the president and members of his inner circle, created policies that benefitted from them at the expense of the people. For instance, they would steal from the IMF and World Bank loans meant for public development. As a result, civil unrest and protests increased in Nigeria.</li><li><strong>Military interventions increased in Nigeria. </strong>— The high levels of corruption and embezzlement of public funds from the IMF and World Bank enticed politicians and the military to<a href=#> overthrow the government</a>. Many only wanted power and influence to enable them to enjoy a piece of the cake.</li><li><strong>Inflation skyrocketed when the government loosened the fiscal policy.</strong> — Inflation was erratic, jumping from 16% to 55% in 1987-1988, dropping to 7% in 1990, and going back to 50% in 1992.</li><li><strong>Nigeria's debt to the WB and IMF pilled up quickly. </strong>— By 1993, it amounted to half of the total expenditure, coming at ‎₦51,616.9 million; every new regime borrowed from the IMF and World Bank than it could repay.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a2aacb7a82ff95cf.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>"We're sorry": Access Bank, UBA, Zenith, other Nigerian banks to close thousands of branches</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a0993e9358b15832.png><h2>What led to the introduction of the Structural Adjustment Programme?</h2><p class=align-left>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Babangida regime introduced </a>the Structural Adjustment Programme on Friday, 27th June 1986, to revamp the country's failing economy after Nigeria declared a state of economic emergency in October 1985.</p><h2>Why did the Structural Adjustment Programme fail in Nigeria?</h2><p class=align-left>Higher interest rates on IMF and World Bank loans, high <a href=#>taxes</a> in Nigeria, recession, and unemployment are reasons the Structural Adjustment Programme failed in Nigeria.</p><h2>What are the negative effects of SAP in developing countries?</h2><p class=align-left>SAPs <a href=#>can</a> <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">increase corruption</a> activities legitimized by anti-corruption discourses.

She married Macaulay, her boyfriend of two years, in 1998 when they were both 17 years old (Macaulay had successfully emancipated himself from his parents in 1996). The two originally met at New York’s Professional Children’s School.</p><p>During their marriage, Rachel and Macaulay were tabloid staples because of their young ages.&nbsp;</p><p>A year before Bully premiered,&nbsp;Rachel and Macaulay split in April of 2000. Their split was announced via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Macaulay's representative</a> at the time, who said, "It is very amicable and they remain best of friends."</p><p>Their divorce was finalized in 2002.

and are funny to point out that don't really harm anybody: like all French people wear scarves.</p><p>So when Jerry Seinfeld had Gad Elmaleh on an episode of Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee and noticed he was wearing a scarf, he went on a whole thing about it and it was great, both him and Gad had a wonderful laugh about it.</p><p>Finding what's truly funny about a stereotype in a comedy bit, however, is one thing, especially when a lot of people perceive it to be true. But then there are stereotypes that are just not true and the only reason people refer to them or bring them up are in a cheap attempt to be funny. One such stereotype is the misconception that women are statistically worse drivers than men.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p></figure><p>As it turns out though, that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">perception is categorically false</a>. Now any subject matter could be made fun of, even this unfair stereotype, but what makes this one particularly harmful was highlighted by this airline pilot who shared her experiences of dealing with snarky remarks from passengers who all made the same joke, more or less, about the fact that she was flying the plane and not a man.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Dreaming in the Caribbean . . . . . . . #sailing #holiday #christmas #pilotlife #pilot #wia #womeninaviation #yacht #wintersun</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>C H A R L O T T E</a> (@charlottethepilot) on Dec 3, 2017 at 10:04am PST</p></figure><p>Her response to the jokes were on the money: she's qualified to fly a really, really, expensive commercial airliner, while the people cracking jokes to her are just qualified to keep their seatbelts on until the overhead light turns off.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Had such a lovely day flying with an 👌 crew.</p><p>Baffled as to why 2 male pax felt that these comments were nescesarry.</p><p>‘I wont make any jokes about female drivers then’</p><p>‘Are you the pilot?

It wasn't unit later when a cabin crew member expressed her anger at the comment that it made me think. Why is this normal?</p>— Charlotte (@pilotcharlotte) <a href=#>May 20, 2018</a></figure><p>Charlotte believes that this nonchalant attitude people have towards women attempting careers in male-dominated fields is exactly what so few women become pilots or enroll in STEM programs.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>It is this attitude that puts women off and another barrier stopping them from going into male dominated careers. It shouldn’t even be a thing!!! I am a pilot he is a pilot. See, there is no difference ..... <a href=#>#pilot</a></p>— Charlotte (@pilotcharlotte) <a href=#>May 20, 2018</a></figure><p>She admitted that her own feelings aren't of anger or frustration, she's just sad that the world is still full of people who think it's OK to say that to a woman who is clearly qualified to do her job.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I didn’t get where I am today by listening to these kinds of comments. I’m not offended, I’m not disheartened. I’m saddened by the fact that this is the attitude some still have and think it is ok to make these comments to women.</p>— Charlotte (@pilotcharlotte) <a href=#>May 20, 2018</a></figure><p>Charlotte's tweets quickly went viral, and it got other people sharing their own annoying run-ins with people who felt the need to belittle the work female pilots do.</p><p>Like this one guy's wife who flew for the military but still gets belittled by passengers when she flies.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My wife’s a pilot, every time she flies she gets a ‘well done dear’ or similar from holidaymakers.<br>None of the troops she flew into Bastion or Kandahar felt the need to patronise her.</p>— Danø 🇬🇧 🇺🇸🇨🇦🇦🇺🇳🇿 (@DanoDXB) <a href=#>May 20, 2018</a></figure><p>Other people thought that Charlotte's response to passengers was perfect and told her not to go too hard on them.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>as are you! being able to laugh it off and remain professional is exactly the reaction they needed. showing them you were unphased by their jokes is perfect. truthfully, they likely meant nothing and were trying to flirt away their feelings of inferiority, but you did perfectly.</p>— scarlet begonia (@reheatmycoffee) <a href=#>May 20, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>they are a testament to the negative effects of toxic masculinity on the subconscious thinking and behaviors of men. pity them. all we have to worry about is advertising telling us our thighs shouldn’t touch, they have to battle existential inferiority.</p>— scarlet begonia (@reheatmycoffee) <a href=#>May 20, 2018</a></figure><p>And there were some other people who offered up some suggestions as to how Charlotte should respond next time.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>"why wouldn't you have gotten on?"<br>"It's just a joke."<br>"But I don't understand"<br>"You know what they say about women drivers"<br>"No, what do they say?"<br>Force them to say it out loud, to confront their own prejudice.</p>— Bowl of petunias (@flyingpat) <a href=#>May 20, 2018</a></figure><p>As it turns out, Charlott's captain had some choice words for some passengers.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Well, if they don't like women pilots they're free to get off & walk.</p>— chiller ★ (@chiller) <a href=#>May 20, 2018</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>This is was the Captains response when he found out 😂</p>— Charlotte (@pilotcharlotte) <a href=#>May 20, 2018</a></figure><p>Obviously, it's not just in the airline industry where women face prejudice when it comes to dealing with men.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>In a job interview last year I was asked how as a female do I deal with men on site...

Like this guy's daughter.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>At 14, my eldest daughter could fly better loops than me.

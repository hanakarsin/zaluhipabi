As much as some folks are passionate about being married and having a family, <a href=#>infidelity</a> is a drug that some people can‚Äôt give up.</p><p>Over the years, there have been tons of stories on social media about people being <a href=#>cheated on</a> and their partner‚Äôs friends knowing about it. And while most people believe that their partner‚Äôs friends are not their friends, that doesn‚Äôt mean blatantly lying to the cheated-on person is acceptable.</p><p>So, when a man shared a <a href=#>TikTok</a> video about berating his friend for trying to cheat on his wife, social media was set ablaze. Here‚Äôs the full scoop.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">A man on TikTok berates his friend for trying to cheat on his wife in the club.</h2><p>Baby ‚Ä¶ not all heroes wear capes!

Apparently, his friend is upset because Deshawn decided to call him out for attempting to cheat on his wife in the club.</p><p>‚ÄúI told him, ‚ÄòBruh, you need to cut that out,‚Äô‚Äù Deshawn said.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@deshawn_sings href=#>@deshawn_sings</a><p>Nope üëéüèæ <a title=foryoupage href=#>#foryoupage</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=tiktok href=#>#tiktok</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=friends href=#>#friends</a> <a title=marriage href=#>#marriage</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Roosevelt VeltBoy Ha" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Roosevelt VeltBoy Ha</a></figure><p>He said that the friend accused him of hating on him, and Deshawn hilariously laid his feelings out on the table.</p><p>‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt hating,‚Äù Deshawn said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt tell you to walk down that aisle. I didn‚Äôt tell you to introduce me to this woman and you go get that ring on your finger. You got me all in this wedding spending all this money to watch you come into this club and cheat and mess it all up ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs my money.‚Äù</p><p>Deshawn went on to share that he spent a lot of money including on a trip to Vegas for a bachelor party and said that since he spent so much, his friend and his wife ‚Äúare staying together.‚Äù LOL!</p><p>The TikToker also shared that his friend bridged the gap for him and his wife to have a good friendship, with him calling her ‚Äúsis.‚Äù So, since he is close to his wife, he doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable lying to her face about his actions.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>‚ÄúBoy you better go get yourself a drink, I‚Äôll pay for it, and sit down somewhere bruh,‚Äù Deshawn said. ‚ÄúNah I spent too much money on y‚Äôall wedding.‚Äù LOL!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Social media users are divided on Deshawn‚Äôs TikTok video.</h2><p>As usual, social media is known to have dissenting opinions about a wide range of topics, and Deshawn‚Äôs video is no exception.</p><p>The general consensus is that Deshawn did the right thing, with plenty of TikTok users applauding him for holding his friend accountable and being a stand-up guy.</p><p>‚ÄúYes! People need to normalize calling their friends out for their inappropriate behavior,‚Äù one person commented.</p><p>‚ÄúMore men need friends like you,‚Äù another person chimed in.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: TikTok/@deshawn_sings</a></figure><p>Interestingly, Deshawn‚Äôs video has grown beyond TikTok and has been reposted by popular blogs such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Shade Room</a>.

[N-word] be so foul like they need to come with two free throws, ‚Äú one man commented.</p><p>‚ÄúMan law: Don‚Äôt speak on another man‚Äôs relationship,‚Äù another man shared.</p><p>On the flip side, other folks shared that Deshawn made them hungry for chicken wings. LOL!</p><p>Truth be told, Deshawn did nothing wrong. Some folks are used to having people in their lives who don‚Äôt hold them accountable when they step out of line. And while Deshawn could have kept certain details off of the Internet ‚Äî so the friend‚Äôs wife won‚Äôt feel embarrassed ‚Äî his point still stands.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Not, ‚ÄúI spent my money.‚Äù üò© This man is going viral after he told his married homeboy not to speak to other women in the club!

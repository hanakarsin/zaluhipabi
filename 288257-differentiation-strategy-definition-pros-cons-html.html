Differentiation strategies are important marketing tools.</p><h2>Definition of differentiation strategy</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/316204fcf4801985.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The top 10 characteristics of a good business opportunity</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This is an approach in which a firm purposes to establish and market an exclusive product for various consumer segments. It is normally employed in firms with clearly defined competitive advantages that can withstand a costly advertising campaign.</p><p class=align-left>Differentiation is based on three parameters; product, pricing, and organization. The outlined below are examples of differentiation strategy, pros, and cons.</p><h2>Differentiation business strategies</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/316204fcf4801985.jpeg><h3>1. Innovation</h3><p class=align-left>Through inventing new products one can differentiate themselves by introducing a new product into the market and establishing themselves as market leaders. Inventions are not easy to come up with and require a budget to be implemented but it provides a unique product into the market.</p><p class=align-left>Innovation is basically the best way to get your presence in the market. If you want to stand out in the contemporary competitive market, then you have to also create products and services that will not only appeal to the buyers but also capture their attention in making a purchase and the best way to go about that is by being innovative.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/25ccc7e83ce99b6e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Importance of advertising in business</span></p></a><h3>2. Customer relations</h3><p class=align-left>A business should maintain high and efficient customer relations to accommodate the different types of customers it serves. Good customer relations is a major differentiation business strategy in the service industry. A poor customer relationship will lead to reduced profits while a good one will earn customer loyalty and ultimately lead to improved profits.</p><p class=align-left>Customer relations means that you understand your customers and rather than just attending to them, you care about their wellbeing and thus you make follow-ups and give them a different experience that excites them and makes them feel both secure and important to you. Customer relations also means that you are willing as the business manager to go out of your way to share the business goals and vision to the customer so they can feel like part of the business.</p><p class=align-left>The customers you make happy today will share the same experience with the rest of their friends and will run to your business for services and products. Purpose to give that one customer the experience of their life through the way you attend to them and they will come back tomorrow for more with more.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1ad4a62a8b14c7d0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The top 10 best accounting courses that are marketable now</span></p></a><h3>3. Branding</h3><p class=align-left>Marketing and advertisement of products is a differentiation based strategy whereby the main aim is to convert customers from your business rivals. Advertisement plays a crucial role in reaching the desired market group. Branded goods are more outstanding than regularly packed goods. Branding is the first impression the customer has of your products.</p><p class=align-left>No matter how good and beautiful your product inside may look or taste if poorly branded, the whole product loses taste and flavor pre-purchase. If you have to stand out, you have to be different from the rest and the first step to that is branding your products to appeal to the market. What are the steps to a good branding process?</p><p class=align-left>First, makes sure you know your target audience if you want to appeal to kids, make sure you are well versed with the latest cartoon features to include in your product branding. Second, create the brands according to the initial plan and the audience you are trying to appeal to.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs19ni0klvm6ao.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Difference between sales and marketing</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Thus, approach a customer with the product sample through displays and sample stand then gather feedback. Finally, create the product and implement the customer opinions about the kind of brand they wish to see.</p><h3>4. Price differentiation</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/0fgjhs7nq1dsibrm.jpeg><p class=align-left>Price differentiation can be achieved by selling at high prices or selling at the least price. Selling at high prices signifies that the products being offered are of higher quality while selling at the least prices attracts consumers who are getting a product at affordable prices.</p><p class=align-left>A differentiation strategy example whereby mobile phones like Samsung and iPhone are expensive and target the well-off individuals while cheaper phones attract price-sensitive consumers. Customers have different preferences on the price factor, too cheap and people will think the quality is poor. And too expensive and customers will shy away in the interest of their budgets.</p><p class=align-left>The best way to go about pricing is to have a market analysis of the prevailing market prices for the kind of good and products you want to launch to help you in deciding how to price your products. If you have to make it cheaper to appeal to the customer than make sure it’s within reasonable margins.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs3sq10j6b3be.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Types of advertising techniques in the Kenyan market</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This applies even to add to the average market prices. Avoid bad pricing habits that lead to cut-throat competition and making it unfair to conduct business for others. Analyze and weigh your options against that of your competitors and arrive at a reasonable price that is both friendly to the market and profitable to you.</p><p class=align-left>The choice of price determines the level of sale but poor pricing is the first avenue to business failure. Your product should be superior compared to other products in the market and it should fulfill the consumers’ needs.</p><h3>5. Target specific consumers</h3><p class=align-left>This differentiation strategy aims to differentiate a business from other similar businesses by offering services and products tailored to specific consumers. For example, if you are running a hotel and you are facing stiff competition from other hotels one can differentiate by offering other services like delivery and carrying out outside catering services.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs3qt1p20de78g.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=#><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Importance of marketing</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Not everybody is your target customer. One of the mistakes most businesses do is to over widen their target market scope to the extent that they overstrain their distribution resources. If you are dealing with products that fit the urban market, avoid overstretching to the rural markets because in so doing the company overstrains and may lead to unforeseen losses.</p><h3>6. Packaging</h3><p class=align-left>The packaging, color, and type of packaging can attract the consumer leading to the consumer purchasing your product over other manufacturers. For example, the tetra pack is an excellent differentiation strategy since the tetra pack is unique compared to other means of packaging.</p><p class=align-left>The packaging just like branding requires that manufacturer is very careful because it comprises the first impressions the customer get about the product. Some packaging designs are too cliché and boring for the youth, while others are too delicate for the children. Always understand your target audience before the choice of packaging.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs2pi3dje8ao7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 10 sources of business ideas & opportunities for entrepreneurs</span></p></a><h3>7. After sales and pre-sales services</h3><p class=align-left>Efficient delivery of services can be a good differentiation strategy as this will earn the business customer loyalty ensuring the customer will purchase goods from the business again thus resulting in improved profits.</p><p class=align-left>Are after sales services any beneficial to the business? Do they reduce the profit of the product and the business in the end? The truth is, having after sales service only attracts more customers and makes you different from numerous other businesses that do not provide these service. However, you should evaluate the profit margin of the product to ensure you do not end up making losses.</p><h3>8. Product differentiation</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/25ccc7e83ce99b6e.jpeg><p class=align-left>Differentiation strategy can be done at the product level. Through differentiation at the product level, different brands from different businesses can easily be identified by the consumer. For example, if a local flying company who mainly fly its customers on local and regional flights whereas another company still offering local and regional flights differentiates and starts flying international flights the brands can easily be distinguished by the consumer.</p><h3>9. User convenience</h3><p class=align-left>As evident in the banking industry, the banks have differentiated by the introduction of mobile banking and the availability of bank agents to easily serve its consumers. User convenience results in the creation of customer loyalty leading to a returning customer.</p><h3>10. Variety of products</h3><p class=align-left>The higher the variety of products being offered by a firm can impact the consumer to purchase a different product from the same manufacturer under a similar brand. The manufacturer often applies this tactic to ensure that the customer still buys their products because they have multiple choices from which the customer can pick from.</p><h2>Advantages of differentiation strategy</h2><ul><li>It allows firms to shield themselves from the competition.</li><li>If a firm has a product that is high in demand the firm can price it higher.</li><li>A company having a better product compared to its competitors can carve out its place in the business community.</li><li>Consumers of differentiated products are not as sensitive to price changes, therefore, the manufacturers can increase their prices.</li><li>Customer loyalty makes it difficult for new firms to enter into the market and compete with the existing firms thus existing firms are able to continue carrying out their functions.</li><li>Firms can create long-lasting reputations and earn customer loyalty by producing higher quality products. They can market their products based on their earlier successes.</li></ul><h2>Disadvantages of differentiation strategy</h2><ul><li>Other firms may out differentiate the existing firms by introducing better unique products into the market.</li><li>Difficulty in the pricing of goods that are not new into the market. As a product remains in the market for longer consumers become smarter about the prices and thus the premium charges being charged can no longer be sustained.</li><li>When substitutes hit the market at lower prices it negatively affects the differentiating firm since consumers will opt for the cheaper products compared to the products being offered at higher prices by the differentiating firm.</li><li>Over differentiation by firms can exceed the firm’s resources as the operation costs become too costly to be covered by the premium prices paid by the consumer?</li><li>Consumers might perceive that the products being offered are of the same quality compared to cheaper brands thus might not purchase the more expensive brands.</li><li>Differentiation can be negative when it is done to the extremes. The differentiation can be too extreme that the consumers don’t believe its credibility or they see it as an excessive luxury.</li><li>Over differentiation of products can lead to the exclusion of some consumers. If a firm dealing with children’s clothing over differentiates and starts producing adult clothing they lose their market in children.</li></ul><p class=align-left>There is nothing as important in business as having a working differentiation strategy that you can apply in your business to make it stand out from the competition. The secret is equipping yourself with at least one of these strategies and implementing it to the latter to realize its benefits to the maximum possible stage. Take a step and introduce one of these strategies for business growth and profitability.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong></p><ul><li>Value chain analysis meaning, importance & examples</li><li>Types of market structures with examples</li><li>Basic principles of marketing</li><li>12 types of leadership styles with examples</li><li>Difference between sales and marketing</li></ul><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2Bl3Fpbm9dmbanssSrnKesmZbBqrvNZqqtqpGpsqjFjJ2cn6GensGqu81mp6uno2KwsLrSZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jesserthelazer-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Jesser - Age, Family, Bio</a>

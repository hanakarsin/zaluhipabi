and TV shows. In fact I'd go so far as to say that it's been my primary source of education, as depressing as that sounds.</p><p>And because of this influence, there are certain "genres" of life that my mind's sequestered into their own categories. I have to be in a certain mood, location, or ambience to give credence to a particular way of thinking. For example, when I was working alone at some hospice at night in college that doubled as a church and funeral home, because I've seen plenty of films where the overnight guard gets murdered by an escaped patient or some monster lurking in the shadows that's yet to be fully revealed to the audience.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: carolco pictures</span></figure><p>Cop dramas, however, exist in another universe for horror films. If I'm hanging out with a bunch of off-duty police officers, I'm not going to get the same heebie jeebies as I would by myself in a hospital. The only thing I'd probably be afraid of is whether or not the cops can smell weed on me. Which is probably why that Eric Bana cop exorcist movie, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deliver us from Evil</a>, felt like it had such a weird premise.</p><p>But if you think about it, law enforcement officers are probably the biggest demographic out there who'll more than likely face paranormal activity. Whenever there's a severe crisis, cops are usually called to handle the situation, right? And if I felt like there was someone in my house but it ended up being a ghost, you best believe I'm phoning the police to deliver me from the spookiness.</p><p>This recent <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ask Reddit</a> thread posed a question to people who worked in Law Enforcement and public service, asking if they ever witnessed anything &nbsp;out of the ordinary. Their answers are pretty chilling.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Cops and other law enforcement people of Reddit, what were some cases you worked on that made you think (even if for a moment) that something supernatural/paranormal was going on?</a>.</figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Cops and other law enforcement people of Reddit, what were some cases you worked on that made you think (even if for a moment) that something supernatural/paranormal was going on?</a>.</figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Cops and other law enforcement people of Reddit, what were some cases you worked on that made you think (even if for a moment) that something supernatural/paranormal was going on?</a>.</figure><p>Some of the stories were more of the "holy moly life is strange" variety than straight up creepy.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Cops and other law enforcement people of Reddit, what were some cases you worked on that made you think (even if for a moment) that something supernatural/paranormal was going on?</a>.</figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Cops and other law enforcement people of Reddit, what were some cases you worked on that made you think (even if for a moment) that something supernatural/paranormal was going on?</a>.</figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p><a href=#>via GIPHY</a></p></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Cops and other law enforcement people of Reddit, what were some cases you worked on that made you think (even if for a moment) that something supernatural/paranormal was going on?</a>.</figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a> from discussion <a href=#>Cops and other law enforcement people of Reddit, what were some cases you worked on that made you think (even if for a moment) that something supernatural/paranormal was going on?</a>.</figure><p>Cops weren't the only ones who provided scary stories of supernatural occurrences.

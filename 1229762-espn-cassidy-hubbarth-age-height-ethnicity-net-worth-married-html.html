Due to her hardworking and persistence, she was proposed to sign a multi-year <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">extension of her contract</a> to stick firmly to the project. She also collaborated with such media as Billboard, Allure, The Wrap, Dime Magazine/UPROXX, The Big Lead, and the Chicago Tribune.</p><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Cassidy Hubbarth net worth</a> is estimated at half a million dollars, while her salary is believed to be 200 thousand dollars per year. The TV anchor goes on working, so in the future, these numbers may potentially rise.</p><p class=align-left>Recently, for example, the broadcaster decided to expand her media potential on social networks. In February it was announced that she was going to start a new half-hour Twitter pregame show with the name “Hoop Streams” before showcase Saturday NBA games on ABC. The show is supposed to be broadcasted from playgrounds. The principle idea of this program is to involve the public into more intimate relations with players, to show the other side of a game. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Hubbarth commented</a>:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b69b6e87c73f1e8c.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The answer to "How much is Ellen worth?" and other incredible facts about her</span></p></a>“You get to know the players’ personalities a lot more in the NBA. It is a much more intimate sport than the other leagues. There are less players. They are not wearing helmets. It kind of takes on a life on its own on social media. Every day there is something meme-able or GIF-able.”<p class=align-left>One may think that such kind of Twitter broadcasting is a desperate try to create hype around the woman, but the reporter claimed in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">one of her interviews</a>:</p>“My interaction on social media isn’t just about tweeting content — it’s about how I consume it and apply it to my job and my reporting. My job is to be a reporter, not to be a personality on Twitter.”<p class=align-left>By the way, her Twitter gathers 125 thousand readers, and her Instagram has 128 thousand followers.</p><p class=align-left>So sport became a big part of Hubbarth’s life, but what is about her private life?

Therefore Cassidy Hubbarth age is currently 34. Her parents Gerry and Emmeline Hubbarth already had two children, and the newsagent was the youngest child in the family.</p><p class=align-left>The newsagent <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">recalled her childhood</a>, studies and parents in one of her interviews:</p>“My high school, Evanston Township High School, is an incredible place. They had a television/radio/film club that I joined, and I got experience calling games for my high school on a local television station. I got some experience there, and I knew when I was looking at colleges that I wanted to find a place where I could study broadcast journalism. However, I come from very humble means, and I got a lot of financial help in scholarships to the University of Illinois, and my parents were like ‘you’re going there.’ I went there my freshman year, and I interned at a radio station and did as much as I could in the communications program, but I begged and pleaded with my parents that I needed to be at Northwestern because of the journalism program there. I applied as a transfer and got accepted. I have no idea how my parents figured it out, but they figured out a way to send me there, and I finished out my degree there in three years.”<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/619d8eb7edc448ee.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Hot photos and top epic facts about Miss Gina Darling age, height, parents, boyfriend</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Cassidy Hubbarth ethnicity is difficult to name, but she was born to a Filipino mother and a father who is of German and Irish descent.
